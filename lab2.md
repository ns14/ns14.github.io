# Lab 2:

Step 1 in Lab 1 was to install the Arduino IDE and follow the setup instructions to install the necessary board and libraries. To test that the board was successfully connected to my computer, I used Example: Blink it Up. This example caused the LED on the board to blink on and off which is useful in the future to denote when the Artemis is on (such as on boot up).

Following this, I followed the Example: Serial. This allowed me to type in character inputs and then receive those same character outputs in the Serial monitor. This would be useful for later parts of the lab when I would need to use the Serial monitor to receive temperature readings from the board.

The first sensor was tested using Example2_analogRead which was the temperature sensor. As can be seen in the video, as I pressed onto the sensor (to warm it up), the temperature reading in the Serial monitor increased. As I waved the sensor around (i.e. causing it to cool down with the cool air), the temperature reading in the Serial monitor decreased.

Lastly, I tested the microphone using Example1_MicrophoneOutput. I used an online note player to see how the frequency of the sound would change. I also then used a music video to see how the microphone would return frequencies that had a lot of noise. It was interesting to see that the microphone was able to discern out the highest frequency noises from the jazz music which actually consisted of a medley of frequencies.
