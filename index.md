# Fast Robots Spring 2024

## Nidhi Sonwalkar

Hi! My name is Nidhi Sonwalkar, and I am a first-semester senior studying mechanical and aerospace engineering student. I am interested in human space flight technologies. I enjoy hiking, travelling, dancing, and choreographing in my free time! This website will showcase the work I've done in Fast Robots in Spring 2024.
