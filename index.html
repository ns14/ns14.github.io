    <h1> Example: Blink It Up! </h1>
    <p> Step 1 in Lab 1 was to install the Arduino IDE and follow the setup instructions to install the necessary board and libraries. To test that the board was successfully connected to my computer, I used Example: Blink it Up. This example caused the LED on the board to blink. </p> 
    <h2> Example: Serial </h>
    <p>       Following this, I followed the Example: Serial. This allowed me to type in character inputs and then receive those same character outputs in the Serial monitor. This would be useful for later parts of the lab when I would need to use the Serial monitor. </p>
    <h3> Example: Analog Read </h3>
    <p> Then, I tested the sensors on the Artemis. The first sensor was tested using Example2_analogRead which was the temperature sensor. As can be seen in the video, as I pressed onto the sensor (to warm it up), the temperature reading in the Serial monitor increased. As I waved the sensor around (i.e. causing it to cool down with the cool air), the temperature reading in the Serial monitor decreased. </p>
    <h2> Example: Analog Read </h2>

Lastly, I tested the microphone using Example1_MicrophoneOutput. I used an online note player to see how the frequency of the sound would change. I also then used a music video to see how the microphone would return frequencies that had a lot of noise. It was interesting to see that the microphone was able to discern out the highest frequency noises from the sound.</p>
